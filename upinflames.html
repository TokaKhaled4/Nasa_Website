            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Waleed Ahmed is a newly homeless 12 year old boy, who watched as his house burned down amidst the frantic
                efforts of the firefighters to contain the fire. He visits the scorched remains of what was his
                childhood home and wonders, “What could we have done to prevent this?”</p>

        <p>Waleed has always loved the forests around his childhood home. True, living so close to the woods came with
            its own risks but it wasn’t anything he couldn’t handle. He was on his way to becoming a real man what with
            his being over 12 years of age! <br><br>He often accompanied his little sister on walks around the town.
            Waleed didn’t like to take walks with her in the forests ‘cause she spent most of that time whining about
            the dirt or the bugs. His mum also warned him against dragging his little sister on his adventures. <br><br>
            At least now, with a little brother on the way, he could finally have someone that would play with him with
            no fear!</p>

        <p>“Mummy, I’m scared,” His little sister sniffled as she cuddled up to their mother, little teddy bear in hand.
            <br><br> “Shush darling, there is nothing to be afraid of.” Mum smiled though Waleed could tell she was very
            scared too. Her smile didn’t look right to him. <br><br> “The situation is gettin’ out of hand...” Grandpa
            muttered, his eyes never leaving the TV. Waleed didn’t like thinking about adult topics like this much. The
            fire-fighters were on their way anyway and the fire would soon be doused. <br><br> He laid his head on the
            window and watched the dark cloud looming over the forest canopy.</p>

        <p>“WALEED!” Mum’s panicked yell jolted him awake. “WALEED GET UP!” <br><br>“Mum?” Waleed rubbed his eyes and
            tried to beat down the fear rising in his chest. He was a big boy now and boys had nothing to be afraid of.
            <br><br>Mum grabbed his arm and pulled him out of bed, dragging him as quickly as she could with her tummy
            as big as it is. <br><br> “Quick darling we don’t have time!” Mum switched her grip to his hand as they
            quickly fled his room. <br><br>Waleed could only cover his nose and cough against the acrid smell of the
            smoke that was filling their house.</p>

        <p>Waleed watched from his place in the ambulance as it drove away from what was previously his house. His mum
            was lying on the bed in the middle of the ambulance, her face black from the smoke. They said she had
            inhaled too much smoke. He didn’t know where his little sister was. <br><br> All he could do was watch as
            his childhood home burned away in the distance, the sirens overtaking everything else.</p>

            less real for that. <br><br> If you wish to understand how something like the Australian Bushfire of 2020
