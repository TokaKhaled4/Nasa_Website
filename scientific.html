    <p id="p1">Climate Change is the process in which long-term shifts occur in weather patterns and temperature. This phenomenon is mostly caused by Global Warming, the process by which Greenhouse Gasses (such as carbon, methane, etc..) get trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere causing the temperature to climb.<br><br> In terms of Greenhouse Gasses our research is concerned with the two most prominent: Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Methane (CH4).</p>
    <p id="p2">Methane emissions differ than those of Carbon Dioxide’s by virtue of being mostly naturally occurring. That is to say that they can occur on their own, and even increase, with minimal human interference. That is not to say that Carbon Dioxide isn’t a naturally occurring gas but the fact remains that in the case of CO2, human activity is a massive contributor to the increase of its emissions.</p>
    <img src="image/contribution-to-temp-rise-by-gas 2.png" alt="" id="img1">
    <p id="p3">(A graph showcasing the effect each gas - CO2, CH4, and N2O - has on Global Warming)</p>
    <p id="p4">Which can be seen in this graph. CO2 emissions are shown to have increased alarmingly over the past century and a half. This coincides with the rise of the industrial system and the rapid growth thereof. As human lead activities increase and get more advanced so too does the emission of Greenhouse Gases in general and CO2 in particular.<br> That is because humans use fossil fuels as the primary source of energy. The burning of these fuels is what causes the worst of the increase in CO2 emissions.</p>
    <img src="image/annual-co2-emissions-per-country 1.png" alt="" id="img2">
    <p id="p5">This can be observed in this graph, which showcases the leading causes of CO2 emissions. It can thus be inferred that, while there can be other factors contributing to the increased emissions of CO2, the leading cause is the burning of Fossil fuels.<br><br> It cannot be said, however, that those other factors aren’t just as damaging as they add up to the pre-existing pollution, causing more emissions.</p>
    <img src="image/co2-fossil-plus-land-use 1.png" alt="" id="img3">
    <p id="p6">When it comes to which countries/regions are most responsible for this severe increase one cannot simply pin the blame on certain areas. That is because each country is contributing to the problem in its own way.</p>
    <img src="image/co2 emissions by country 2021 1.png" alt="" id="img4">
    <p id="p7">That said, the graphs on the right clearly represent where the CO2 emissions of each country stands. Most of it comes from countries where industrialization is most prominent. Most notably: China, which is closely followed by the United States.     </p>
    <p id="p8">Following those two countries are the European Union, the rest of Europe beyond said Union, and finally Asia. For the rest of the world beyond the aforementioned areas, the emissions can be considered negligible.</p>

    <p id="p9">(A graph showing the cumulative emissions - the grand total of emissions accumulated over the years - by country. Asia is clearly the continent with the most Carbon emissions followed closely by North America - including the U.S.A.)</p>
<img src="image/cumulative-co-emissions 1.png" alt="" class="" id="img7">
<p id="p10">(Another heat graph showing the cumulative emissions, this one from 2022. Emissions are most concentrated in Asia (Mostly in China and India) and North America (Mostly in the U.S.A.)</p>

<img src="image/chart_methane-emissions  1.png" alt="" class="" id="img10">
<p id="p13">As with CO2, Methane emissions have also increased dramatically over the past 150+ years. Unlike CO2 though it can be seen (on the graph on the right) that Methane has existed in the atmosphere in high quantities since the beginning. This is because Methane mostly occurs through agricultural practices such as: Livestock emissions, Paddy Rice cultivating, etc... <br><br> As agricultural practices evolved, however, Methane emissions began to increase.</p>
<img src="image/source methane 1.png" alt="" id="img11">
<p id="p14">(A graph showcasing all the different factors that may cause an increase in Methane emissions. Agriculture is the highest with energy and waste coming second and third while other causes are attributed to last place.)</p>
<img src="image/methane-emissions 1.png" alt="" id="img12">
<p id="p15">On the right is  a cumulation map of Methane emissions until 2022. Since Methane mostly originates from agricultural practices you should find that the countries with the highest accumulated rate of Methane gas are the countries with the highest number of livestock (i.e. China, U.S.A, Brazil, India, etc..)<br><br>
    Countries with moderate agricultural practices also have moderate Methane emissions.</p>

<span id="p16">(A graph showcasing the concentration of Methane over the past 8 years. It is showing a somewhat gradual increase after 2016.)</span>
<span id="p17">(A graph showcasing the concentration of Methane over the past 8 years month by month. It is showing an unstable increase and decrease in the emission of Methane up until 2021 and then a steady climb from then to today.)</span>
<p id="conc">Since Climate Change is caused by the harmful activities humans partake in, it is up to us to set limits and boundaries on those activities. That can be achieved by finding more eco-friendly energy alternatives that won’t generate as much Greenhouses Gasses and act to reduce the damage caused to the atmosphere.<br><br> For instance: Carbon emissions are increased by the constant consumption of fossil fuels and other such forms of energy materials. Switching over from fuel based machines to ones powered by solar energy, eolic (wind) energy, or hydroelectric power will lessen the load significantly on our atmosphere.<br><br> Methane emissions, on the other hand, can be reduced by changing the process by which we grow our livestock - changing what they eat, managing their stress levels, etc.. - or finding new ways to grow crops that require Methane producing bacteria through bio-engineering or other such lab processes.<br><br> Finally, what you can do as a viewer is, if you have the means to do so, donate to the various organizations that are fighting for our cause. If you do not possess the means to do so then simply spreading awareness and getting the message to the proper parties will go a long way.<br><br> If you have any more questions feel free to head on over to the <a href="faq.html">FAQs</a> page!
